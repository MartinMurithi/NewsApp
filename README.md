        ##NEWS ROOM APPLICATION##
    -> This is an application that consumes the News API to collect news articles from various media houses and displays them in a recyclerview.
    -> It allows the user to click on the card(news article), directs the user to another activity which uses a web-view to display a web like interface to
        display the news in details.
    -> The app allows a user to select different news categories such as sports, entertainment, health, technology and business.
    -> A user can search for news he/she is interested in.

        ##Technologies used##
    -> News Api
    -> Retrofit, a library that allows user to retrieve and post data from web services. I specifically used the @GET function and inserted
     the api endpoint from where to retrieve the data.
    -> Glide, a library that loads image from urls into an application. I used an image url provided by the API to load the image
     and display it in the news article.
